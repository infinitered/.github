## Welcome to Infinite Red's GitHub home!

Infinite Red ([infinite.red](https://infinite.red/?r=github-ir-readme)) is a [React Native consultancy](https://infinite.red/react-native-consultants) based entirely in the USA and Canada. We help companies build their apps using React Native and Expo. We have over ~70~ ~75~ 85 projects under our belt!

We've been around since 2015! _(and really since well before that, as it was born from a merger!)_ You can learn more about our beginnings on our founders' podcast, [Building Infinite Red](https://building.infinite.red/).

> [!NOTE]
> Open source software is in our DNA! The owners of Infinite Red (Jamon, Gant, and Todd) met through their involvement in the Ruby open source world, and from the very beginning we've been active in open source.

We are known for a lot of React Native themed code, media, and events:

- [Chain React Conf](https://chainreactconf.com) is the only React Native focused conference in the USA.
- [React Native Radio](https://reactnativeradio.com) is the biggest React Native podcast, hosted by our CTO **Jamon Holmgren**, Director of Engineering **Robin Heinze**, and Senior Software Engineer **Mazen Chami**.
- [React Native Newsletter](https://reactnativenewsletter.com) is the most popular React Native newsletter.
- [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) is a battle-tested (continuous development since 2016!) React Native starter kit.
- [Reactotron](https://reactotron.com) is our popular React and React Native debugging/inspecting free desktop tool.
- [Red Shift](https://shift.infinite.red) is our tech blog, all about React Native (and some random non-tech posts)
- ...and much more!
